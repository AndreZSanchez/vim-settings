This is my personal way of syncing my vim settings across multiple machines.  It relies on Vundle.
To use this from a new computer I must install Vim, clone this repo, put the sample.vimrc as .vimrc
in my profile (making sure to point it to main.vim in the newly cloned repo), and install Vundle
normally.

If I want to change something, I simply make the change in the vim-settings repo, and then
commit and push the changes to Github so that I can pull them from my other machines.
